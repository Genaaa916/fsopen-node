# fsopen-node
A small fullstack project for a course. The course provides instructions, which I can proudly admit to not reading. The code (mainly React) may be unconventional or suboptimal, but I'm trying to figure React out with as little hand-holding as possible. 
I'll probably read the documentation more thoroughly and come back to this project to fix any abnormalities. 
The main point is the website works as intended.
The non-minified front-end code is in the other repository called 'fullstackopen'.
Most likely in branch osa-2.16. 
The stack is also hosted on Render.
